Hey there. So in my last video I talked

00:01.960 --> 00:03.400
about giving a self introduction

00:03.400 --> 00:05.120
presentation and I talked about the

00:05.120 --> 00:07.480
importance of relating who you are to

00:07.520 --> 00:09.160
your audience to make sure that they will

00:09.160 --> 00:11.360
be engaged with what you're talking about

00:11.360 --> 00:13.120
and really care about who you are as a

00:13.120 --> 00:15.280
person. In this video, I'm going to talk

00:15.280 --> 00:17.520
about what you can say specifically when

00:17.520 --> 00:18.960
you're giving a 60 second.
